  This project is designed to dynamically generate a custom team html file for a user's project.  With a series of prompts and selections, a user is able to create a file of a current team quickly, instead of having to waste time creating and writing one from scratch.

4. Find or create the folder the user wants to work in and enter the following commands the the Git terminal:
   1. git clone [copied link] (_this will allow access the repository to the local computer._)
   2. git pull (_this will pull all the lines of script from the local repository._)
   3. code . (\*This will extract the code and link the paths to VSCode for review/editing/uploading)
5. In the the terminal, please run "npm install" (as the dependencie should be there) to download the modules necessary for this project to work.
